# Why rindexer?

## Why do we need rindexer in general?

Indexing data on EVM chains is crucial for developers creating dApps or just general data reporting.
Building the necessary indexing infrastructure, however, presents significant challenges.
It is complex, time-consuming, and can divert focus from the task at hand and in a lot of cases even stop the task from moving forward.
As applications become more complex with more advanced features, the need for robust, easily extendable indexing solutions grows.
Some great indexing tools exist already mainly all in JavaScript so adding a rust based indexer tool creates more indexing options
which is important for the industry.

## The Problems

Traditional indexing solutions come with steep learning curves and require substantial initial development to meet dApps
specific needs. This requirement can delay overall application development and add complexity, especially when integrating
with different chain environments. Additionally, many tools do not offer the flexibility needed to quickly adapt to
changing project requirements.

Effective indexing tools should be easy to use, requiring no-code for basic data reporting or basic indexing needs, while also
being highly customizable for more advanced requirements. We are building more and more advanced applications that require
more advanced indexing tools, and rindexer is designed to meet these needs as well.

The use of Rust in EVM chain tools like Foundry and Reth has demonstrated significant performance improvements on existing toolsets, 
which rindexer also leverages.

## Developer Experience

rindexer significantly enhances the developer experience by simplifying the setup and management of indexing tasks.
Its straightforward YAML-based configuration allows anyone to begin indexing events without writing any code,
enabling them to concentrate more on their application's logic or profiling the data itself.
For those seeking to build more advanced indexing rindexer provides a framework abstracting the complexity of how you get the chains data,
allowing developers to focus on the projects logic and not the low-level chain indexing specifics.

## Performance

Rust was chosen for developing rindexer due to its unmatched performance and efficiency. Its capacity for handling intensive
computation and its memory safetyâ€”without needing a garbage collector allows rindexer to manage high-throughput data with minimal
latency. This makes rindexer a very fast indexing solution, essential for applications that require real-time
data analysis and for developers who value speed and efficiency.
