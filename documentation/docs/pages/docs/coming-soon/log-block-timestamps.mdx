# Log block timestamp

## What is the problem

Within a log result in the JSONRPC spec it does not expose the block timestamp, which means it requires another
block lookup per each log to get the block timestamp. This is not efficient and can cause a big bottleneck in
indexing, slowing indexing down by 10-50x in some cases.

You can see the proposal to add block timestamps to logs [here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposal-for-adding-blocktimestamp-to-logs-object-returned-by-eth-getlogs-and-related-requests/11183).
Alongside reth has already supported this feature for a while now. That said most nodes at the moment are not reth meaning
this bottleneck is still a problem.

## How do we want to handle it

At the moment rindexer does not expose block timestamps with the logs when indexing. We want to add this feature
but we are not willing to slow down the indexer by 10-50x to get this indexing in the traditional way.
We are working on an approach which will allow block timestamps to be exposed in the logs without slowing down the indexer.

## No block timestamp pain points

Time is an important factor to have but only really on viewing the data. If you just want to order the data or aggregate
the data you just need to know which log came first which is already possible with the block number alongside the
tx index and log index which is already exposed in the logs. Most programmatic use cases do not need the block timestamp.

That said we understand that some use cases do need the block timestamp, for example, if you are doing a time series
analysis on the data you will need the block timestamp. We believe we can solve this problem in a much more
efficient way than the traditional way.
