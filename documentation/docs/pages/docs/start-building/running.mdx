# Running

## No-code Project

You can run the no-code project really easily with the CLI toolset.

:::info
rindexer starts your postgres docker compose file up for you automatically if the DATABASE_URL can not connect to the database and docker-compose.yml is present in the parent directory.
You will need to make sure you have docker running on your machine before starting the project. If you have not got docker you can install it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
You can also run docker manually by using `docker compose up -d`.
:::

:::warn
graphql API can only be ran when you have a postgres storage setup in your YAML.
:::

:::code-group

```bash [indexer and graphql]
rindexer start all
```

```bash [indexer]
rindexer start indexer
```

```bash [graphql]
rindexer start graphql
```

:::

You can change the GraphQL port by doing --port [number] in both all and graphql commands above.

:::info
If you change your contract ABIs or want to start fresh you can use the [delete](/docs/start-building/delete) command to drop all the data and start over.
You can also use the [drop_each_run](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#drop_each_run) option in the YAML configuration file to drop all the data for the indexer before starting.
:::

## Rust Project

If you want to run this with docker support for the postgres first run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then to run the the rust project you can run the following command:

:::info
You are creating a rust rindexer project you should be wanting to change all of this logic to suit your needs.
Just like react create app exposes you to the boilerplate code to get you started, this is the same.
If you change the main.rs some of the arguments like --indexer and --graphql may not run with these
commands but as you would of changed it you will know how to run it.
:::

:::code-group

```bash [everything]
cargo run
```

```bash [indexer only]
cargo run -- --indexer
```

```bash [graphql only]
cargo run -- --graphql
```

:::

We also advise you in production to run your rust projects in release mode, you can run it in release mode using

```bash
cargo run --release
```

You can also do other fancy production builds with other frameworks like jemalloc and other flags, but we will leave that to you to explore.
