# Running

## No-code Project

You can run the no-code project really easily with the CLI toolset.

:::info
graphql API can only be ran when you have a postgres storage setup in your YAML.
:::

:::code-group

```bash [indexer and graphql]
rindexer start all
```

```bash [indexer]
rindexer start indexer
```

```bash [graphql]
rindexer start graphql
```

:::

You can change the GraphQL port by doing --port [number] in both all and graphql commands above.

## Rust Project

You can run the rust project the same way as the no-code project, note though the rust projects are meant to be
changed and extended so what the template gives you is just a starting point. You may choice to run the indexer
differently and compile it to production standards. Once you do that you can start using cargo builds and runs which
we will not cover here.
