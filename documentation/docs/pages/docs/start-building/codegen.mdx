# Codegen

You can generate a few different types of code when using rindexer codegen.

## GraphQL

You can generate .graphql prebuilt queries to get up and running in seconds.
These will be generated in a `queries` folder.

```bash
rindexer codegen graphql --endpoint=graphql_api
```

Direct path:

```bash
rindexer codegen --path=./location graphql --endpoint=graphql_api
```

## Typings

:::info
This feature is only available for Rust projects.
:::

When creating a new rust project with rindexer it will create you a typings folder, this has pretty advanced
typings for all your contracts, events and network information. This is generated from the ABIs you provide in the YAML configuration file.
This folder is not meant to be manually edited and should always be generated using codegen.

You can regenerate the typings folder by running the following command:

:::info
note if you change the ABIs in the YAML file you will need to regenerate the typings. Also if you do regenerate this
most likely your indexer files will need to be updated to match the new typings, you can manually migrate them or
generate them again using the below if you do not have any custom logic.
:::

```bash
rindexer codegen typings
```

## Indexers

:::info
This feature is only available for Rust projects.
:::

When creating a new rust project with rindexer it will create you a indexers folder, this is where you will write
your custom logic for the indexer. This is where you will do all your indexing logic, you can do anything you want
in here, you can do http requests, on chain lookups, custom logic, custom DBs, anything you can think of. rindexer gives you
the foundations and also baked in extendability. Rust enforces a strong type system, all logs will be streamed to you
just focus on the logic you want.

By default if you turn storage postgres on in the YAML configuration file it will also create you postgres tables,
also write SQL for you to use and expose you a postgres client. This is a great starting point for you to build on.

The tables creation can be skipped by using the [disable_create_tables](docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#disable_create_tables)
in the YAML configuration file.

If you also enable the CSV storage it will also generate code in the handler to write to that CSV files.

You can regenerate the indexers folder by running the following command, please note this will overwrite
any custom logic you have written if you run it on an existing project.

```bash
rindexer codegen indexers
```
