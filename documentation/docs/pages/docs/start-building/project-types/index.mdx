# Project Types

rindexer has two types of projects you can create:

- [No-code Project](/docs/start-building/project-types/no-code-project) - No-code project is where you can start indexing chain events without writing any code.

This is what a lot of people will use to get started with rindexer.
- [Rust Project](/docs/start-building/project-types/rust-project) - Rust project is where you can create custom indexing systems using Rust.

This is for more advanced users who want to build more complex indexing systems.
