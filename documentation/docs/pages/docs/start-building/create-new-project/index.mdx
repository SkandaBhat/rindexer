# Create New Project

rindexer provides two modes for creating new projects, each optimized for different use cases and infrastructure setups.

## Choose Your Mode

### Standard Mode (Most common setup)

The default way to create and run rindexer projects. This mode connects to blockchain nodes via RPC endpoints and is suitable for every use case.

### Reth Mode (Advanced)

An advanced mode that integrates directly with Reth nodes using Execution Extensions (ExEx).

**Requirements:**
- Running Reth archive node
- Advanced knowledge of Ethereum infrastructure
