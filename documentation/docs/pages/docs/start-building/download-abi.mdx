# Download ABI

This allows you to download ABIs from an supported network using Etherscan API.

:::note
It will download the ABI and put it in the `abis` folder named by the contract name with `.abi.json` namespace.
If that folder does not exist it will create it.
:::

You can see all the chains you can download ABIs from [here](https://docs.etherscan.io/contract-verification/supported-chains).

```bash
rindexer download-abi
```

it then ask you 2 questions:

1. "Please enter the Enter Network Chain Id" - This is the chain id of the network you want to download the ABI from.
2. "Please enter the contract address" - This is the contract address you want to download the ABI from.

It will then download the ABI and put it in the `abis` folder. You can then map it in the YAML file.

- If the contract is not verified on Etherscan it will not be able to download the ABI.
- If the contract is a proxy it try to download the ABI of the implementation contract.
