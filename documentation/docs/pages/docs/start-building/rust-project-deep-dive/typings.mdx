# Typings

When creating a new rust project with rindexer it will create you a typings folder, this has pretty advanced
typings for all your contracts, events and network information. This is generated from the ABIs you provide in the YAML configuration file.
This folder is not meant to be manually edited and should always be generated using codegen.

You can regenerate the typings folder by running the following command:

:::info
note if you change anything in the YAML file you will need to regenerate the typings. Also if you do regenerate this
most likely your indexer files will need to be updated to match the new typings, you can manually migrate them or
generate them again using the below if you do not have any custom logic.
:::

```bash
rindexer codegen typings
```
