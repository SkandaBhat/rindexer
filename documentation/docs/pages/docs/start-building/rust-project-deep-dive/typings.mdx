# Typings

When creating a new rust project with rindexer it will create you a typings folder, this has pretty advanced
typings for all your contracts, events and network information. This is generated from the ABIs you provide in the YAML configuration file.
This folder is not meant to be manually edited and should always be generated using codegen.

You can regenerate the typings folder by running the following command:

:::info
rindexer tries to be as smart as possible when it comes to updating the typings based on the `rindexer.yaml`,
it will resolves as much as it can without needing a regenerate but like any codegen tool if you
change certain aspects it does need to be regenerated.

if you change any of these properties in the `rindexer.yaml` file it will need to be regenerated:

- [indexer name](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/top-level-fields#name)
- anything in the [network](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/networks) section including adding and removing networks
- enabling or disabling a new [storage provider](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage)
- changing the [contract name](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#name)
- changing from [address](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#address)
contract indexing to [filter](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#filter) indexing or vice versa
- changing the contract [ABI](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#abi)
- anything in the [global](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/global) section

Also if you do regenerate your indexer files may need to be updated to match the new typings, you can manually migrate them or
generate them again using [indexer codegen command](/docs/start-building/codegen#indexers)

```bash
rindexer codegen typings
