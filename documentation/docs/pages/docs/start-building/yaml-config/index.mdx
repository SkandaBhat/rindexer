# Overview of the YAML Configuration File

The YAML configuration file is the heart of your rindexer project. It defines the project's name,
description, repository, and the contracts that will be used to index the data.
This file is used to set up the project and configure the indexing tasks that will be performed.

**YAML is case-sensitive, so make sure to use the correct case when defining the fields in the configuration file.**

:::info
YAML files can be used to store sensitive information, you can use environment variables to store this information.
The syntax for this in the YAML is `${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}`.

## YAML structure

- [Top level fields](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/top-level-fields) - The top-level fields of the YAML configuration file.
- [Networks](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/networks) - The networks to listen for events on are defined in the YAML configuration file.
- [Storage](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage) - The storage configuration is defined in the YAML configuration file.
- [Contracts](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts) - The indexers of the project are defined in the YAML configuration file.
- [Global](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/global) - The global events to listen for are defined in the YAML configuration file.


## Example YAML no-code configuration file

### For Contract Address

Filter events for a specific address.

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
indexers:
- name: MyFirstIndexerExample
  contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      address: 0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
    - Transfer
    - Approval
```

### Filter for an event across all contracts

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
indexers:
- name: MyFirstIndexerExample
  contracts:
  - name: TransferEvents
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      filter:
        event_name: Transfer
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/ERC20.abi.json
```

### Filter for an event across all contracts against indexed values

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
indexers:
- name: MyFirstIndexerExample
  contracts:
  - name: TransferEventForAddress
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      filter:
        event_name: Transfer
        indexed_1:
          - 0x4A1a2197f307222cD67A1762D9A352F64558d9Be
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/ERC20.abi.json
```
