# Create New Project

:::info
Make sure you have the CLI installed before starting a new project.
You can find the installation instructions [here](/docs/introduction/installation).
:::

## 1. Create a new project

:::code-group

```bash [no-code]
rindexer new no-code
```

```bash [rust]
rindexer new rust
```

:::

If any of the steps are unclear, you can find more information in the [New Project Appendix](#new-project-appendix).

Once completed a new boilerplate project will be created in the current directory. You can navigate to the project directory and start building your project.
The boilerplate project is configured to index rETH transfer and approval events from ethereum mainnet between a specific block range.

## 2. Add Environment Variables

Open up the generated `.env` file and fill in the required environment variables.

### DATABASE_URL

:::warning
- SKIP IF POSTGRES WAS NOT ENABLED
- SKIP IF POSTGRES DOCKER SUPPORT WAS ENABLED
:::

Only required if postgres storage was enabled but docker support was marked as no in the project creation step.

For ease of running locally we suggest you enable docker support on the rindexer project.

If you have picked postgres storage but did NOT pick docker support out the box you will have to fill in the `.env`
file with the correct database url.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=FILL_IN
```

## 3. Start the project

To start the project you can run the following command:

:::info
graphql can only run if you have postgres storage enabled
:::

:::code-group

```bash [graphql and indexer]
rindexer start all
```

```bash [indexer only]
rindexer start indexer
```

```bash [graphql only]
rindexer start graphql
```

:::

:::warning
The boilerplate template uses a free node which may get rate limited, you can change the node URL in the
`.env` file to a paid node, we suggest alchemy or tenderly.
:::

## 4. Query the GraphQL API

:::info
graphql can only run if you have postgres storage enabled
:::

TODO: Add instructions on how to query the GraphQL API.

### Generate Typescript SDK for your dApp

TODO: Add instructions on how to generate a typescript SDK for your dApp.

## New Project Appendix

If you are not sure what to select this section will explain each step in more detail.

### What Storages To Enable?

- Postgres - This will use a postgres database to store the data.
- Csv - This will store the data in a csv file on the machine.
- Both - This will store the data in both a postgres database and a csv file.
- None - This will not store the data anywhere.

### Postgres Docker

- Yes - This will use docker to spin up a postgres database for you.
- No - This will not use docker and you will need to provide a postgres database information in the `.env` file.
