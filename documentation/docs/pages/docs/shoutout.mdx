# Shoutout

Big big thanks to [Avara](https://avara.xyz/) who allowed me to finish this off in work time.

Also big thanks to [Foundry's](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) release github workflow
which we took inspiration from to build the cross platform rindexer binaries. Building the cross platform binaries
was harder then building the whole project lol.
