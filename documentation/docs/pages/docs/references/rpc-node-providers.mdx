# RPC node providers

RPC providers speed has a direct link to how fast you can index data, providers who try to return data as fast as possible are the best providers to have.
With RPC providers the fastest providers are ones which return you the to and from block ranges even if you supply an out of range block request.
This means you can extract that data from the error message and use it to get the the biggest depth of logs out of a single request.
The slower providers give you a max block range and this means you have to crawl through the blocks to get the logs even if no data is in the blocks, 
this is a lot slower.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) has some very fast nodes and in internal testing with free nodes they blew everyone out the water
for returning the most event logs in the fastest time.

Keep in mind that the public RPC are rate limited.

For production use, itâ€™s recommended use a dedicated Node RPC.
