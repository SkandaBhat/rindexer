# rindexer_cli

This is the cli for rindexer, it contains all the logic for the cli and is how users interact with rindexer.

You can get to the full rindexer [documentation](https://rindexer.xyz/docs/introduction/installation).

## Install

```bash
curl -L https://rindexer.xyz/install.sh | bash
```

If youâ€™re on Windows, you will need to install and use Git BASH or WSL, as your terminal,
since rindexer installation does not support Powershell or Cmd.

## Use rindexer

Once installed you can run `rindexer --help` in your terminal to see all the commands available to you.

```bash
rindexer --help
```

```bash
Blazing fast EVM indexing tool built in rust

## Working with CLI locally

The best way to work with the CLI is to use the `cargo run` command with args after it inside the CLI project, 
for example if I wanted to create a new project I would run:

```bash
cargo run -- new --path PATH_TO_CREATE_PROJECT no-code
```

This would create a new no-code project in the path you specified.

If you wanted to look at the help you can run:

```bash
cargo run -- help
```

This will show you all the commands available to you.
