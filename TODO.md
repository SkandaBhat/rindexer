# rindexer

bugs:
- RUST PROJECT ISSUE - // TODO - this is not correct (this will be fixed if we remove some repeated info from the code)
  - FIX - TODO - FIX THIS
  
lastly:
- write indexes docs + exposes graphql settings including filter only on indexed columns and disable advanced filters
- write relationships docs + write code to inject into the dependency events to process correctly
- cleanup the code into smaller files and functions
- open repo and install from GitHub for rust projects

nice to have:
- look at the final unwraps
- add unit tests as much as possible (time box 3 hours)
