# rindexer

bugs:
- RUST PROJECT ISSUE - // TODO - this is not correct (this will be fixed if we remove some repeated info from the code)
  - FIX - TODO - FIX THIS + refactor rindexer_core to rindexer
  
lastly:
- try to handle callback failing
- cleanup the code into smaller files and functions

nice to have:
- look at the final unwraps
- add unit tests as much as possible (time box 3 hours)
