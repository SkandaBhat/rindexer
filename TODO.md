# rindexer

checklist v1.0:
- do benchmarks with a few different projects
- add ability to add indexes to the database (this in turn is defining what you want to query on so will fix ordering speed)
- add validation method into the yaml file to check certain things are mapped correctly

bugs:
- RUST PROJECT ISSUE - // TODO - this is not correct (this will be fixed if we remove some repeated info from the code)
  - FIX - TODO - FIX THIS
  
lastly:
- update the docs to include the new features + changes
  - write relationships docs + write code to add to the dependency events
- cleanup the code into smaller files and functions
- add unit tests as much as possible (time box 3 hours)

nice to have:
- look at the final unwraps
- look into PK with tx hash and tx index and log index to make it unique and not have to worry about duplicates
