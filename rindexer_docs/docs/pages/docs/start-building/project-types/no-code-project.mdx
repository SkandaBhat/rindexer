# No-code Project

The No-code Project type in rindexer is designed for users who wish to quickly set up and deploy indexing solutions without delving into
the complexities of coding. This project type leverages a YAML-based configuration that guides you through specifying what data to index and
how to index it. It's an ideal solution for those who need to implement standard indexing tasks, or for developers who prefer to focus more
on application logic than on the intricacies of the indexing process.

**Features:**
- **Easy Configuration**: Set up your indexing pipeline with a simple YAML file. Define what blockchain events to listen
for and how they should be processed with just a few lines of configuration.
- **Quick Deployment**: With the no-code setup, your project can be up and running in minutes. This rapid deployment
allows you to see results quickly and make adjustments as needed without digging into code.
- **Focus on Use Cases**: This project type is perfect for use cases that don't require specialized processing.
It allows you to focus on the application's functionality rather than on the backend logistics of data handling.

**Ideal For:**
- Data profiling and basic indexing tasks.
- Projects with straightforward indexing needs.
- Fast prototyping and MVP developments.
