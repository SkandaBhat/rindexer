# Rust Project

Requires you to have rust installed on your machine. You can install rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

The Rust Project type is tailored for developers looking to build sophisticated and highly customized indexing systems.
This approach utilizes the full power of Rust, offering you the tools to write safe, efficient, and highly concurrent code.
By choosing the Rust Project, you can extend the basic capabilities of rindexer with custom logic, complex data transformations,
and optimizations tailored to your specific needs.

**Features:**
- **High Performance**: Leverage Rustâ€™s renowned performance and efficiency to handle large-scale data processing and high-throughput applications.
- **Customizable Indexing Logic**: Implement custom indexing logic and data transformations that go beyond the default configurations offered in the no-code projects.
- **Advanced Data Handling**: Integrate advanced data handling capabilities, such as contract code lookups, API lookups, complex queries, and data aggregation, to suit your specific application needs.

**Ideal For:**
- Advanced projects requiring tailored indexing solutions.
- Custom indexing solutions that go beyond the capabilities of the no-code projects.
- Building an indexer on top of your contracts for others to run

Each project type addresses different user needs and expertise levels, providing flexibility in how you choose to implement
and scale your indexing solutions with rindexer. Whether you prefer a straightforward, configuration-driven approach or a
custom, code-intensive implementation, rindexer supports your development journey.
