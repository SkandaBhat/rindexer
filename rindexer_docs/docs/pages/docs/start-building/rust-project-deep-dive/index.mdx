# Rust Project Deep Dive

As explained in the [rust](/docs/start-building/project-types/rust-project) project type,
the Rust project is a project that is meant to be changed and extended. The template gives you a starting point,
and you may choose to run the indexer differently, use your own custom logic, do http requests, do on chain lookups
or anything else you can think of. rindexer is also a framework that can be used to build your own custom indexer
and not just a no-code indexer.
