# Project Types

rindexer has two types of projects you can create:

- No-code Project - No-code project is a project where you can start indexing without writing any code.
- Rust Project - Rust project is a project where you can create a custom and more advanced indexing systems using Rust.

### No-code Project

The No-code Project type in rindexer is designed for users who wish to quickly set up and deploy indexing solutions without delving into
the complexities of coding. This project type leverages a YAML-based configuration that guides you through specifying what data to index and
how to index it. It's an ideal solution for those who need to implement standard indexing tasks, or for developers who prefer to focus more
on application logic than on the intricacies of the indexing process.

**Features:**
- **Easy Configuration**: Set up your indexing pipeline with a simple YAML file. Define what blockchain events to listen
for and how they should be processed with just a few lines of configuration.
- **Quick Deployment**: With the no-code setup, your project can be up and running in minutes. This rapid deployment
allows you to see results quickly and make adjustments as needed without digging into code.
- **Focus on Use Cases**: This project type is perfect for use cases that don't require specialized processing.
It allows you to focus on the application's functionality rather than on the backend logistics of data handling.

**Ideal For:**
- Data profiling and basic indexing tasks.
- Projects with straightforward indexing needs.
- Fast prototyping and MVP developments.

### Rust Project

The Rust Project type is tailored for developers looking to build sophisticated and highly customized indexing systems.
This approach utilizes the full power of Rust, offering you the tools to write safe, efficient, and highly concurrent code.
By choosing the Rust Project, you can extend the basic capabilities of rindexer with custom logic, complex data transformations,
and optimizations tailored to your specific needs.

**Features:**
- **High Performance**: Leverage Rustâ€™s renowned performance and efficiency to handle large-scale data processing and high-throughput applications.
- **Customizable Indexing Logic**: Implement custom indexing logic and data transformations that go beyond the default configurations offered in the no-code projects.
- **Advanced Data Handling**: Integrate advanced data handling capabilities, such as contract code lookups, API lookups, complex queries, and data aggregation, to suit your specific application needs.

**Ideal For:**
- Advanced projects requiring tailored indexing solutions.
- Custom indexing solutions that go beyond the capabilities of the no-code projects.
- Building an indexer on top of your contracts for others to run

Each project type addresses different user needs and expertise levels, providing flexibility in how you choose to implement
and scale your indexing solutions with rindexer. Whether you prefer a straightforward, configuration-driven approach or a
custom, code-intensive implementation, rindexer supports your development journey.
