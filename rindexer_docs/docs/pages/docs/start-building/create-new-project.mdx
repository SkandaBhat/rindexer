# Create New Project

## 1. Initialise a new project

To start a new project with rindexer, you can use the `new` command. This command will guide you through the process
of creating a new project, allowing you to choose between a no-code project and a Rust project.

If any of the steps are unclear, you can find more information in the [New Project Appendix](#new-project-appendix).

```bash
rindexer new
```

Once completed a new boilerplate project will be created in the current directory. You can navigate to the project directory and start building your project.
The boilerplate project is configured to index rETH transfer and approval events from ethereum mainnet between a specific block range.

## 2. Add Environment Variables

:::info
- SKIP IF POSTGRES WAS NOT ENABLED
- SKIP IF POSTGRES DOCKER SUPPORT WAS ENABLED
:::

Only required if postgres storage was enabled but docker support was marked as no in the project creation step.
For ease of running locally we suggest you enable docker support on the rindexer project.

If you have picked postgres storage but NOT picked docker support out the box you have to fill in the `.env`
file with the correct database information.

```bash
DATABASE_NAME=FILL_IN
DATABASE_USER=FILL_IN
DATABASE_PASSWORD=FILL_IN
DATABASE_HOST=FILL_IN
DATABASE_PORT=FILL_IN
```

## 3. Start the project

To start the project you can run the following command:

:::info
graphql can only run if you have postgres storage enabled
:::

:::code-group

```bash [graphql and indexer]
rindexer start all
```

```bash [indexer only]
rindexer start indexer
```

```bash [graphql only]
rindexer start graphql
```

:::

:::warning
The boilerplate template uses a free node which has very limited rate limits, you can change the node URL in the
`.env` file to a node you control or have access to.
:::

## 4. Query the GraphQL API

:::info
graphql can only run if you have postgres storage enabled
:::

TODO: Add instructions on how to query the GraphQL API.

## New Project Appendix

If you are not sure what to select this section will explain each step in more detail.

### What Type Of Project?

If unsure what project type to select, you can read more about each project type here:

- [No-code Project](/docs/start-building/project-types#no-code-project)
- [Rust Project](/docs/start-building/project-types#rust-project)

### What Storages To Enable?

- Postgres - This will use a postgres database to store the data.
- Csv - This will store the data in a csv file on the machine.
- Both - This will store the data in both a postgres database and a csv file.
- None - This will not store the data anywhere.

### Postgres Docker

- Yes - This will use docker to spin up a postgres database for you.
- No - This will not use docker and you will need to provide a postgres database information in the `.env` file.
