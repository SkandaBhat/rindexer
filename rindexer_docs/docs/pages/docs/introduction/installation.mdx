# Installation

rindexer installation process is simple and can be done with a few steps.

## rindexer

rindexer operates as a CLI toolset to make it easy to create new rindexer projects or run existing ones.

:::code-group

```bash [macOS]
curl -L https://rindexer.io/install | bash
```

```bash [linux]
curl -L https://rindexer.io/install | bash
```

```bash [windows]
TODO
```

:::

Once installed you can run the following command to check the installation was successful:

```bash
rindexer --help
```

To upgrade to the latest version of rindexer you can run the following command:

```bash
rindexer upgrade
```

## Docker

rindexer uses docker to spin up postgres databases for you when it runs locally so its recommended to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
if you don't have it installed already.

**If you are using csv or none storage options you do not need to install docker, it is only recommended with postgres.**

## Rust - optional

If you are only doing no-code projects you do not need rust installed but if you are doing rust projects you will need to install rust.
You can install rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

That is it lets now walk through how you can start using rindexer.
