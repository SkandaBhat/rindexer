# Why rindexer?

## Why do we need rindexer in general?

Indexing data on EVM chains is crucial for developers creating dApps.
Building the necessary indexing infrastructure, however, presents significant challenges.
It is complex, time-consuming, and can divert focus from developing innovative dApp features.
As applications become more complex with more advanced features, the need for robust, easily extendable indexing solutions grows.
Although decentralized options like TheGraph exist, they often lack speed and are not as developer friendly as you need.
Diverse indexing options, such as rindexer, are vital for building high-quality applications efficiently.

## The Problems

Traditional indexing solutions come with steep learning curves and require substantial initial development to meet dApps
specific needs. This requirement can delay overall application development and add complexity, especially when integrating
with different blockchain environments. Additionally, many tools do not offer the flexibility needed to quickly adapt to
changing project requirements or updates in blockchain technology.

Effective indexing tools should be easy to use, requiring no-code for basic data reporting or basic indexing needs, while also
being highly customizable for more advanced requirements. We are building more and more advanced applications that require
more advanced indexing tools, and rindexer is designed to meet these needs as well.

The use of Rust in blockchain tools like Foundry has demonstrated significant performance improvements on existing toolsets, which rindexer also leverages.

## Developer Experience

rindexer significantly enhances the developer experience by simplifying the setup and management of indexing tasks.
Its straightforward YAML-based configuration allows anyone to begin indexing events without writing any code,
enabling them to concentrate more on their application's logic or profiling the data itself.
For those seeking to build more advanced indexing rindexer provides out the box support to abstract away the complexity of the blockchain.

## Stability

In blockchain applications, stability is critical as data integrity and availability directly affect user trust and usability.
rindexers design utilizes Rust’s safety features and concurrency capabilities, ensuring fast, reliable,
and secure indexing operations, safeguarded against data races and system crashes.

## Performance

Rust was chosen for developing rindexer due to its unmatched performance and efficiency. Its capacity for handling intensive
computation and its memory safety—without needing a garbage collector allows rindexer to manage high-throughput data with minimal
latency. This makes rindexer a very fast indexing solution, essential for applications that require real-time
data analysis and for developers who value speed and efficiency.
